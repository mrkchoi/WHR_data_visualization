World Happiness Report is an interactive data visualization based off the annual World Happiness Report. Over 1096 data points from 156 countries were aggregated to give an exploratory visual of the state of global happiness.  

This year's World Happiness Report focuses on happiness and the community: how happiness has evolved over the past dozen years, with a focus on the technologies, social norms, conflicts and government policies that have driven those changes.  

This tool allows you to explore the study, customize the statistics, and share the facts.
